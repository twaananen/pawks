# Pawks

Pawks is a dog park service with the goal of being easy to access for infomation, minimal user privacy intrusion and simple ux for interaction.

The motivation is my personal need to know more about the dog parks around me, so I can optimize my visits. This is also a hobby/learning project which means there might be multiple implementations of the same features.
